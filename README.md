# climate-boston

Using R and HTML/CSS, this project is an analysis of Boston neighborhoods and their varying social vulnerabilities to the effects of urban heat, related to climate change. I completed this in October 25, 2020 as part of a graduate course, Visualization Technologies I: Fundamentals. Though there are things I would go back and change now (aesthetic appearance, choices in types of graphs, webpage spacing), I am uploading this version because it is one of my earlier projects with R. Everyone has to start somewhere. 

In the future, I would update this project with 2020 U.S. Census data.

Included in the repository are:
* RedClimateBos.Rmd is the markdown of the analysis (with R code and links to data sources)
* RedClimateBos.html is the knitted version of the Rmd file
* redclimateboston_webpage.html and redclimate_style.css are the HTML/CSS files for the webpage (contains no R code)
* The "data" folder contains data used to make the various plots
* The "img" folder contains output plots generated using R (dplyr, ggplot2)
